<!-- Here's the revised "About Me" paragraph incorporating your interest in the Apple Developer Academy:

**About Me - Example for Full-Stack Developer & Aspiring Entrepreneur**

Passionate Full-Stack Developer & Entrepreneur
Building innovative web apps and businesses that make a difference drives me. My tech journey began after high school, and BINUS's NAR 23-1 program accelerated my skills in Flutter, Kotlin, and web development. I'm particularly passionate about user-friendly mobile and web apps.

Beyond Coding
Technology can solve real-world problems! I'm building KRONE.ID, a crypto news app, and CreationsCreaturesID, an online isopod pet business.

Sharing Knowledge & Values
I believe in sharing knowledge. During university, I mentored fellow students, and their growth has been rewarding. As a Christian, I strive to share values and make a positive impact, inspired by Steve Jobs (you can add the quote here).

FOOTER - QUOTES
<!-- The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world
are the ones who do. -->
<!-- Steve Jobs -->

<!-- Feel free to reach out! Let's connect and discuss how we can work together to give value to other people! -->
